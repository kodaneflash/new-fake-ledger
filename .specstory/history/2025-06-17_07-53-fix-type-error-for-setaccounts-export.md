# Fix type error for setAccounts export (2025-06-17 03:53:56)

Fix this type error Module '"~/actions/accounts"' has no exported member 'setAccounts'.    @staticmodification.md follow typesript interfaces  @https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/wiki/LLC:AccountBridge @Ledger Live but make sure it works with my @staticmodification.md implementation  take everything into account when fixing

I see you're running into a TypeScript error with the static data feature. It seems like the `setAccounts` action is not being exported from the correct location. I'll investigate the codebase to find the right way to set the accounts in the Redux store and apply the necessary fix.

First, I will explore the `actions` directory to understand how account-related actions are structured.

Okay, I see an `accounts.ts` file in the `actions` directory. I'll read its contents to see which actions are exported and find the correct one to use.

Model provided invalid arguments to read file tool.

My apologies. I'll read the entire file since it's short.

---

Read file: apps/ledger-live-mobile/src/actions/accounts.ts

I've examined `apps/ledger-live-mobile/src/actions/accounts.ts` and found `replaceAccounts` tied to `AccountsActionTypes.SET_ACCOUNTS`, which seems correct. Since `staticmodification.md` uses `setAccounts(staticAccounts)` where `staticAccounts` is `AccountLike[]`, I'll switch to `replaceAccounts`. I'll now verify the `AccountsReplacePayload` type in `apps/ledger-live-mobile/src/actions/types.ts`.
