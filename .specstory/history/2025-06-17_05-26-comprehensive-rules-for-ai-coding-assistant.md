Of course. I will create a comprehensive set of rules for an AI coding assistant that can be used for development on this project. The rules will be based on the provided documentation and files, covering architecture, coding patterns, data flow, and more.

I will create a new file named `AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDELINES.md` with these rules.
